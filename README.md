## Angular CLI: multiple Apps
You may need to have an Angular project that has multiple apps so you can run the build of a particular app, say depending on the customer you’re preparing the build for. In my case, I wanted to create a project with multiple apps that I use in my Angular workshops. Having a single project with multiple apps allows you to run a time-consuming npm or yarn install once and just modify the name of the app you want to run.

The angular team is working on the Angular Elements module that will allow you to create Angular widgets that you’ll be able to embed into any HTML app. This should allow you to have multiple apps on the same HTML page as well. This feature should be available in the upcoming Angular 6 releases.
Also, Angular CLI 6 makes it easier to configure multiple apps in the same project in their new configuration file angular.json (a replacement for .angular-cli.json).
